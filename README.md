# Sandwichboy

A game representing my life of the past 3 or so years. I will not be expanding on this statement.

Navigate to https://icodevery1337.github.io/Sandwichboy/ to play it online. Desktop only as you need the arrow keys to move!

Initially I was focused on good programming practices, but I let go of that dream to rather get this finished 🙂

## Running locally

Make sure you have python installed.

```console
git clone git@github.com:ICodeVery1337/Sandwichboy.git
cd Sandwichboy
python -m http.server 8888
```

And then navigate to http://localhost:8888/

```
